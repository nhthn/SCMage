categories:: UGens>Generators

SCMage is an interface to the MAGE/pHTS real-time speech synthesizer.

classmethods::

method:: ar

argument:: buf
Not used. Reserved for reading labels from a buffer.

argument:: freqValue
argument:: freqMode

These two parameters allow you to modify or replace the pitch of the speech. Mode -1 means "do nothing," mode 0 is overwrite, mode 1 is shift, mode 2 is scale.

argument:: timeScale
The slowdown factor for frames. MAGE limits this to the range [1/240, 20].

note:: MAGE refers to this internally as "speed," which has the opposite function of what you'd expect. I've taken the liberty of changing the name but not the behavior. ::

argument:: alpha
The vocal tract length, from 0 (Donald Duck) to 1 (the whispers of Satan incarnate).
